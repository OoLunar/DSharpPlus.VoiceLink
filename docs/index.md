# DSharpPlus.CommandAll
CommandAll (informally referred to as CA) is a custom command library written by [OoLunar](https://github.com/OoLunar) which supports both text commands and application commands. The ultimate goal is to have the capabilities of both the [`CommandsNext`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DSharpPlus.CommandsNext) and the [`SlashCommands`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DSharpPlus.SlashCommands) packages. CommandAll makes a best effort basis on writing efficient, yet easily usable code for everyone.

If you are new to DSharpPlus, I recommend following the [Example Bots](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/Example-Bots) that I have written, which is intended to introduce you to the library. If you are new to C# or even programming in general, I recommend following the [C# Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/) on Microsoft's website before attempting to use this library.

All articles are written under the assumption that your program has connected to the Discord gateway using DSharpPlus. If you are unsure how to do this, please refer to the [Example Bots, HelloWorld Example](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/Example-Bots/tree/4.3.0/src/Core/HelloWorld).

Lastly, if you ever get confused or stuck with these articles, we do have a support server: [Forsaken Programmers, `#commandall` channel](https://discord.gg/6bjPzA8P6h). While not as active, you may also use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/OoLunar/DSharpPlus.CommandAll/discussions) for support.
